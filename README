	this is a sketch I'm using for time lapse photography with my
	canon EOS 50D. 

	get a N3 connector, a 2N2222 transistor and wire it up:
		n3 white wire [ground] -> arduino ground
		n3 red wire [shutter] -> 2N2222 collector 
		arduino ground -> 2N2222 emitter 
		arduino pin7 -> 2N2222 base

	I'll draw a schematic when I have time.
